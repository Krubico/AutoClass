I took some Sklearn classifiers and build an algorithm to find the best one for your dataset.

How to use:
Step 1: You put in your dataset (.csv) (You can convert your excel dataset to csv)
Step 2: Wait
Step 3: Get the best classifier, parameters and score for your dataset

Dataset Format: 
Independent variables | Dependent variables 
In any order before   | Last index
last index            |
                      |
                      |


I included:

Sklearn Classifiers:

Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Gradient-Boosted Random Forest Regression - Catboost

Sklearn Clusters:
